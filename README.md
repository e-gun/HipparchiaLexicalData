# HipparchiaLexicalData
dictionaries, grammatical data, word counts

here you will find:
* P J Heslin's prebuilt data
* H Dik's logeion entries
* pre-built wordcounts via a run of `HipparchiaBuilder` followed by `archivewordcounts.py` [which is availaible in this repository]

***

Heslin's pre-built data is cloned from:

* https://github.com/pjheslin/diogenes-prebuilt-data

But that data is itself derived from 

* https://github.com/helmadik/LSJLogeion

* https://github.com/PerseusDL/lexica

`logeion.lsj.xml.gz` was generated via `logeion_joiner.py` which was run 
inside of a clone of https://github.com/helmadik/LSJLogeion
 

These datasets have the following notices attached to them:
* Logeion

	all Greek converted to Unicode; many entries split or merged. 
	If using these files, please credit Perseus Tufts and Helma Dik/Logeion,
